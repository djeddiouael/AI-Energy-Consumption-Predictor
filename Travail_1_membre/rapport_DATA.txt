Data Cleaning Pipeline - Code Analysis Report

Overview
This is a comprehensive data cleaning pipeline for building energy efficiency data. The code is organized into logical modules that handle different aspects of the data cleaning process.

Code Organization by Module

data_exploration.py - Data Loading & Initial Analysis
Purpose: Loads data and performs initial exploration.

Key Functions:
load_data(): Safely loads CSV files with error handling
explore_data(): Generates comprehensive data profile
analyze_missing_patterns(): Examines missing value distribution

Features:
Basic dataset information (shape, columns)
Data types analysis
Statistical summaries
Missing values analysis
Duplicate detection

data_cleaning.py - Core Cleaning Operations
Purpose: Handles fundamental data cleaning tasks.

Key Functions:
handle_missing_values(): Fills missing values using smart strategies
remove_duplicates(): Identifies and removes duplicate rows
detect_outliers_iqr(): Finds outliers using Interquartile Range method
handle_outliers(): Treats outliers by capping or removal
clean_numerical_data(): Combined function for numerical data cleaning

Cleaning Strategies:
Missing Values: Auto (median/mode), mean, median, mode, or drop
Outliers: Capping at bounds or complete removal
Duplicates: Keep first, last, or remove all

quality_validation.py - Domain-Specific Validation & Pipeline
Purpose: Validates data against domain rules and orchestrates the entire pipeline.

Key Components:
validate_building_data(): Applies building physics constraints
DataCleaningPipeline class: Main orchestrator class

Validation Rules:
Relative_Compactness: 0 to 1 range
Surface areas: Must be positive
Orientation: Only values 2,3,4,5 allowed
Glazing_Area: 0 to 1 range
Heating/Cooling_Load: Non-negative values

Pipeline Class Features:
Step-by-step execution logging
Comprehensive cleaning statistics tracking
Data saving capabilities
Progress reporting

analysis_report.py - Visualization & Reporting
Purpose: Generates visual reports and statistical summaries.

Key Functions:
create_cleaning_report(): 6-panel visual comparison
generate_statistical_summary(): Detailed statistics
create_feature_analysis(): Individual feature analysis

Visual Reports Include:
Missing values before/after comparison
Data distribution changes
Correlation matrices
Cleaning statistics
Data quality metrics

Complete Workflow

Step 1: Data Loading & Exploration
df = load_data('data.csv')
exploration_results = explore_data(df)

Step 2: Missing Value Treatment
df_cleaned, missing_fixes = handle_missing_values(df, strategy='auto')

Step 3: Duplicate Removal
df_cleaned, duplicate_fixes = remove_duplicates(df_cleaned)

Step 4: Domain Validation
df_cleaned, validation_results, validation_fixes = validate_building_data(df_cleaned)

Step 5: Outlier Handling
df_cleaned, outlier_fixes = handle_outliers(df_cleaned, method='cap')

Step 6: Reporting & Analysis
create_cleaning_report(original_data, cleaned_data, cleaning_stats)
generate_statistical_summary(cleaned_data)
